+VER=-version-info 0:0:0
+# This flag accepts an argument of the form current[:revision[:age]]. So,
+# passing -version-info 3:12:1 sets current to 3, revision to 12, and age to
+# 1.
+#
+# If either revision or age are omitted, they default to 0. Also note that age
+# must be less than or equal to the current interface number.
+#
+# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information: 
+#
+# 1.Start with version information of 0:0:0 for each libtool library.
+#
+# 2.Update the version information only immediately before a public release of
+# your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee
+# that the current interface number gets larger faster.
+#
+# 3.If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then
+# increment revision (c:r+1:a)
+#
+# 4.If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
+# update, increment current, and set revision to 0. (c+1:r=0:a)
+#
+# 5.If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
+# increment age. (c:r:a+1)
+#
+# 6.If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
+# set age to 0. (c:r:a=0)
