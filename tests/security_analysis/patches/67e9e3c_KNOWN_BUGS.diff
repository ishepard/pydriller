  "system context" will make it use wrong(?) user name - at least when compared
  to what winhttp does. See https://curl.se/bug/view.cgi?id=535
 
-6.4 Negotiate and Kerberos V5 need a fake user name
-
- In order to get Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication to work in HTTP or Kerberos
- V5 in the email protocols, you need to  provide a (fake) user name (this
- concerns both curl and the lib) because the code wrongly only considers
- authentication if there's a user name provided by setting
- conn->bits.user_passwd in url.c  https://curl.se/bug/view.cgi?id=440 How?
- https://curl.se/mail/lib-2004-08/0182.html A possible solution is to
- either modify this variable to be set or introduce a variable such as
- new conn->bits.want_authentication which is set when any of the authentication
- options are set.
