+1.33 make DoH inherit more transfer properties
+
+ Some options are not inherited because they are not relevant for the DoH SSL
+ connections, or inheriting the option may result in unexpected behavior. For
+ example the user's debug function callback is not inherited because it would
+ be unexpected for internal handles (ie DoH handles) to be passed to that
+ callback.
+
+ If an option is not inherited then it is not possible to set it separately
+ for DoH without a DoH-specific option. For example:
+ CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST, CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYPEER and
+ CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS.
