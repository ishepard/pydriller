+Long: sasl-authzid
+Help: Use this identity to act as during SASL PLAIN authentication
+Added: 7.66.0
+---
+Use this authorisation identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN authentication,
+in addition to the authentication identity (authcid) as specified by --user.
+
+If the option isn't specified, the server will derive the authzid from the
+authcid, but if specified, and depending on the server implementation, it may
+be used to access another user's inbox, that the user has been granted access
+to, or a shared mailbox for example.
