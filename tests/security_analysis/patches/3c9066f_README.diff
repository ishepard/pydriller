+ 1.1.1 Installation of python-impacket
+
+  The Python-based test servers support both recent Python 2 and 3.
+  You can figure out your default Python interpreter with python -V
+
   Please install python-impacket in the correct Python environment.
-  At the moment the Python-based test servers still require Python 2.
-  Therefore you will need to use pip2 or your OS' package manager to
-  install the Python 2 version of impacket (if it is still available).
+  You can use pip or your OS' package manager to install 'impacket'.
+
+  On Debian/Ubuntu the package names are:
+    Python 2: 'python-impacket'
+    Python 3: 'python3-impacket'
+
+  On FreeBSD the package names are:
+    Python 2: 'py27-impacket'
+    Python 3: 'py37-impacket'
+
+  On any system where pip is available:
+    Python 2: 'pip2 install impacket'
+    Python 3: 'pip3 install impacket'
 
-  On stable Debian/Ubuntu the package name is "python-impacket".
-  On FreeBSD the package name is "py27-impacket".
+  You may also need to manually install the Python package 'six'
+  as that may be a missing requirement for impacket on Python 3.
