 Tracing of DNS operations to resolve hostnames and HTTPS records.
 
+## `lib-ids`
+
+Adds transfer and connection identifiers as prefix to every call to
+CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3). The format is `[n-m]` where `n` is the identifier
+of the transfer and `m` is the identifier of the connection. A literal `x`
+is used for internal transfers or when no connection is assigned.
+
+For example, `[5-x]` is the prefix for transfer 5 that has no
+connection. The command line tool `curl`uses the same format for its
+`--trace-ids` option.
+
+`lib-ids` is intended for libcurl applications that handle multiple
+transfers but have no own way to identify in trace output which transfer
+a trace event is connected to.
