+  1.14 How do I submit my patch?
+
+  When you have made a patch or a change of whatever sort, and want to submit
+  that to the project, there are a few different ways we prefer:
+
+  o send a patch to the curl-library mailing list. We're many subscribers
+    there and there are lots of people who can review patches, comment on them
+    and "receive" them properly.
+
+  o if your patch changes or fixes a bug, you can also opt to submit a bug
+    report in the bug tracker and attach your patch there. There are less
+    people involved there.
+
+  Lots of more details are found in the CONTRIBUTE and INTERNALS docs.
