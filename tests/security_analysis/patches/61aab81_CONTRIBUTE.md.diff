+Sometimes the tests fail due to a dependency service temporarily being offline
+or otherwise unavailable, eg. package downloads. In this case you can just
+try to update your pull requests to rerun the tests later as described below.
+
+You can update your pull requests by pushing new commits or force-pushing
+changes to existing commits. Force-pushing an amended commit without any
+actual content changed also allows you to retrigger the tests for that commit.
+
 When you adjust your pull requests after review, consider squashing the
 commits so that we can review the full updated version more easily.
