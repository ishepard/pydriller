-## Metalink
-
-Curl supports Metalink (both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are supported), a way
-to list multiple URIs and hashes for a file. Curl will make use of the mirrors
-listed within for failover if there are errors (such as the file or server not
-being available). It will also verify the hash of the file after the download
-completes. The Metalink file itself is downloaded and processed in memory and
-not stored in the local file system.
-
-Example to use a remote Metalink file:
-
-    curl --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink
-
-To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE protocol
-(`file://`):
-
-    curl --metalink file:///example.metalink
-
-Please note that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is no way to use a local
-Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also note that if `--metalink` and
-`--include` are used together, `--include` will be ignored. This is because
-including headers in the response will break Metalink parser and if the
-headers are included in the file described in Metalink file, hash check will
-fail.
