+## SQLite3 SQL Injection
+
+_Support for this is limited, before raising issues, please ensure you are prepared to work on debugging, do not simply claim "it does not work"._
+
+By default, SQLi and Blind SQLi are done against the MariaDB/MySQL server used by the site but it is possible to switch to do the SQLi testing against SQLite3 instead.
+
+I am not going to cover how to get SQLite3 working with PHP, but it should be a simple case of installing the `php-sqlite3` package and making sure it is enabled.
+
+To make the switch, simply edit the config file and add or edit these lines:
+
+```
+$_DVWA["SQLI_DB"] = "sqlite";
+$_DVWA["SQLITE_DB"] = "sqli.db";
+```
+
+By default it uses the file `database/sqli.db`, if you mess it up, simply copy `database/sqli.db.dist` over the top.
+
+The challenges are exactly the same as for MySQL, they just run against SQLite3 instead.
