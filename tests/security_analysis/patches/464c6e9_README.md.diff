-DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APP
-=======================
-
-Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.
-
-WARNING!
-========
-
-Damn Vulnerable Web App is damn vulnerable! Do not upload it to your hosting provider's public html folder or any working web
-server as it will be hacked. I recommend downloading and installing XAMPP onto a local machine inside your LAN which is used solely for testing.
-
-We do not take responsibility for the way in which any one uses Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA). We have made the purposes of the application clear and it should not be used maliciously. We have given warnings and taken measures to prevent users from installing DVWA on to live web servers. If your web server is compromised via an installation of DVWA it is not our responsibility it is the responsibility of the person/s who uploaded and installed it.

-
-In .htaccess:
-
-Replace:
-```
-  <IfModule mod_php5.c>

-    #php_flag allow_url_fopen on
-    #php_flag allow_url_include on
-  </IfModule>
-```

-With:
-```
-  <IfModule mod_php5.c>

-
--A. If your running IE8 or above IE actively filters any XSS. To disable the filter you can do so by setting the HTTP header 'X-XSS-Protection: 0' or disable it from internet options. There may also be ways to bypass the filter.
