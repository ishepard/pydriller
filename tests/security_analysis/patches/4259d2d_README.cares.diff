-c-ares
-======
-
-This package is based on ares 1.1.1 (written by Greg Hudson). I decided to
-fork and release a separate project since the ares author didn't want the
-improvements that were vital for our use of it.
-
-This package is dubbed 'c-ares' since I (Daniel Stenberg) wanted this for use
-within the curl project (hence the letter C) and it makes a nice pun. Also,
-c-ares is not API compatible with ares: a new name makes that more obvious to
-the public.
-
-The full source code is available in the 'c-ares' release archives, and in the
-'ares' subdir of the curl CVS source repository.
-
-If you find bugs, correct flaws, have questions or have comments in general in
-regard to c-ares (or by all means the original ares too), get in touch with us
-on the c-ares mailing list: http://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/c-ares
-
-c-ares is of course distributed under the same MIT-style license as the
-original ares.
-
-You'll find all c-ares details and news here:

-NOTES FOR C-ARES HACKERS
-
-The following notes apply to c-ares version 1.7.0 and later.
-
-* The distributed ares_build.h file is only intended to be used on systems
-  which can not run the also distributed configure script.
-
-* The distributed ares_build.h file is generated as a copy of ares_build.h.dist
-  when the c-ares source code distribution archive file is originally created.
-
-* If you check out from CVS on a non-configure platform, you must run the
-  appropriate buildconf* script to set up ares_build.h and other local files
-  before being able of compiling the library.
-
-* On systems capable of running the configure script, the configure process
-  will overwrite the distributed ares_build.h file with one that is suitable
-  and specific to the library being configured and built, this new file is
-  generated from the ares_build.h.in template file.
-
-* If you intend to distribute an already compiled c-ares library you _MUST_
-  also distribute along with it the generated ares_build.h which has been
-  used to compile it. Otherwise the library will be of no use for the users of
-  the library that you have built. It is _your_ responsability to provide this
-  file. No one at the c-ares project can know how you have built the library.
-
-* File ares_build.h includes platform and configuration dependent info,
-  and must not be modified by anyone. Configure script generates it for you.
-
-* We cannot assume anything else but very basic compiler features being
-  present. While c-ares requires an ANSI C compiler to build, some of the
-  earlier ANSI compilers clearly can't deal with some preprocessor operators.
-
-* Newlines must remain unix-style for older compilers' sake.
-
-* Comments must be written in the old-style /* unnested C-fashion */
