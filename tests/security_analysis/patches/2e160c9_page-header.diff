+.SH VARIABLES
+Starting in curl 8.3.0, curl supports command line variables. Set variables
+with --variable name=content or --variable name@file (where "file" can be
+stdin if set to a single dash (-)).
+
+Variable contents can expanded in option parameters using "{{name}}" (without
+the quotes) if the option name is prefixed with "--expand-". This gets the
+contents of the variable "name" inserted, or a blank if the name does not
+exist as a variable. Insert "{{" verbatim in the string by prefixing it with a
+backslash, like "\\{{".
+
+You an access and expand environment variables by first importing them. You
+can select to either require the environment variable to be set or you can
+provide a default value in case it is not already set. Plain --variable %name
+imports the variable called 'name' but exits with an error if that environment
+variable is not alreadty set. To provide a default value if it is not set, use
+--variable %name=content or --variable %name@content.
+
+Example. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail if USER is not
+set:
+
+ --variable '%USER'
+ --expand-url = "https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method"
+
+When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that can make the
+variable contents more convenient to use. It can trim leading and trailing
+white space with "trim", it can output the contents as a JSON quoted string
+with "json" and it can URL encode the string with "urlencode". You apply
+function to a variable expansion, add them colon separated to the right side
+of the variable. Variable content holding null bytes that are not encoded when
+expanded, will cause error.
+
+Exmaple: get the contents of a file called $HOME/.secret into a variable
+called "fix". Make sure that the content is trimmed and percent-encoded sent
+as POST data:
+
+  --variable %HOME
+  --expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret
+  --expand-data "{{fix:trim:urlencode}}"
+  https://example.com/
+
+Command line variables and expansions were added in in 8.3.0.
 .SH OUTPUT
 If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can be
 instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the --output or
